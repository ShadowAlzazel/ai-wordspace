Thought for a second


**Figure 5.2.1: Comparison of Top-10 Similarity Distributions**
The overlaid histograms display the empirical distributions of the top-k cosine similarities $S_{(1)}, S_{(2)}, \dots, S_{(10)}$ collected over $T=500$ trials (with vocabulary size $V=50{,}000$ and embedding dimension $D$). Each rank $k$ produces a roughly Gaussian-shaped distribution whose mean $\mu_k$ and standard deviation $\sigma_k$ are annotated in the legend. As expected from order‐statistic theory, the top-1 similarities concentrate most tightly and attain the highest mean (here $\mu_1\approx0.705$), while subsequent ranks show progressively smaller means and slightly larger spreads. The gradual shift of the bell curves to the left and their slight broadening for increasing $k$ visually confirms that higher-rank (i.e., lower similarity) neighbors both decrease in typical similarity and exhibit greater variability across trials.

**Figure 5.2.2: Similarity Decay with Rank (Real Model & Exponential Fit)**
This plot traces the mean cosine similarity $\overline{S}_{(k)}$ (blue points) as a function of neighbor 
rank $k=1\ldots10$ for three real query words (“computer,” “ocean,” “democracy”) using the Mistral-7B-v0.3 embeddings.
 Vertical error bars denote the empirical standard deviation across the three queries.
We observe a pronounced decay from $\overline{S}_{(1)}\approx0.705$ down to $\overline{S}_{(10)}\approx0.665$. Fitting an exponential model

$$
f(k) \;=\; a\,e^{-b\,k} \;+\; c
$$

yields parameters $a=0.0592$, $b=0.4922$, and $c=0.6668$ (red curve), 
indicating a rapid initial drop that asymptotically approaches a baseline similarity $c$. This behavior mirrors the simulated order‐statistic trend and supports the
 theoretical approximation $\mu_1\approx\sqrt{2\log(V)/D}$, while also highlighting how real embedding spaces introduce an empirical “floor” similarity
  due to semantic structure and model artifacts.
