# Statistics Through the AI “Word-space”

This project demonstrates how statistics and vector-space models are used in AI and machine learning to analyze semantic similarity between words using embeddings.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow the steps below.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher must be installed. You can check with:

```bash
python --version
```
* Link to python https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

*Optional: Use the provided script to automate this step.*

### 3. (Optional) Use the Provided Bash Script

You can use `start_env.bat` to automatically set up and activate the virtual environment:

**On Windows:**

```bash
bash start_env.bat
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
bash start_env.sh
```

> Be sure the script has execute permissions:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x start_env.sh
> ```

### 4. Install Required Packages

Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary dependencies with (This takes a while):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the Showcase Function

To test the project, run the following script from the command line:

```bash
python closest_word_analyzer.py --words tea milk --semantic-words chai coffee latte
```

This command compares the input words ("tea", "milk") against a semantic set ("chai", "coffee", "latte") and returns the most similar matches using word embeddings.
